# XGBoost-Vs-LSTM
Files contain two machine learning models and a feature selection algorithm.
The machine learning models are implementations of an XGBoost Gradient Boosted Trees (xg) and a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network. The feature selection is done using a Tabu Search algorithm.

Run functions in the Experiment file to explore the impact of raising renewable energy contributions on CO2 emissions.
