# XGBoost-Vs-LSTM
Files contain two machine learning models and a feature selection algorithm.
The machine learning models are implementations of an XGBoost Gradient Boosted Trees (xg) and a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network. The feature selection is done using a Tabu Search algorithm.

TO DO

DONE Run Feature Selection for both Algos and Store Results

DONE Run Both Algos with and without feature selection and store results

Implement Alt input data

Create plot charting the rmses for the feature selection

Create plot comparing predictions per year for the algos with and without feature selection for dataset 1

Create plot comparing predictions per year for the algos with and without feature selection for dataset 2

Bonus create plot for the cost convergence of the feature selection algo
