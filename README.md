# XGBoost-Vs-LSTM
Files contain two machine learning models and a feature selection algorithm.
The machine learning models are implementations of an XGBoost Gradient Boosted Trees (xg) and a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network. The feature selection is done using a Tabu Search algorithm.

TO DO

Create plot charting the rmses for the feature selection

Bonus create plot for the cost convergence of the feature selection algo

write report
