# XGBoost-Vs-LSTM
Files contain two machine learning models and a feature selection algorithm.
The machine learning models are implementations of an XGBoost Gradient Boosted Trees (xg) and a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network. The feature selection is done using a Tabu Search algorithm.

TO DO

Run Feature Selection for both Algos and Store Results

Run Both Algos 10 times with and without feature selection and store results

Create Plot of Feature Selection Containing Results from Both Algos.

Create Two plots: one with the run per RMSE for each algo

another with the predicted and actual emisisons a year for each algo with and without feature selection



write report
