# XGBoost-Vs-LSTM
Files contain two machine learning models and a feature selection algorithm.
The machine learning models are implementations of an XGBoost Gradient Boosted Trees (xg) and a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network. The feature selection is done using a Tabu Search algorithm.

TO DO

make feature selection work

decide on predictions and performance tests

produce performance and prediction anaysis

write report

clean code and review that tests still work
